# Python Capstone Project

**Objective:**

To develop a robust Python-based data processing workflow that cleans, transforms, and analyzes multi-source datasets, enabling accurate reporting, insightful analysis, and data-driven decision-making.

**Description:**

Designed, structured, and prepared multiple datasets using Pandas, ensuring data consistency, organization, and readiness for analysis; exported processed data as CSV files for downstream reporting and modeling.

Performed comprehensive data cleaning, detecting and resolving missing values by applying a running average algorithm implemented with Python for loops, significantly improving dataset completeness and reliability.

Merged and integrated datasets from multiple sources, consolidating related information into unified structures for seamless analysis and cross-referencing.

Created calculated metrics and applied predefined business rules to enhance analytical depth, update existing data, and uncover actionable insights.

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify meaningful patterns, correlations, and emerging trends, providing a strong foundation for advanced statistical or predictive modeling.

Implemented conditional logic within Python scripts to automate decision-making processes, enabling dynamic outputs based on varying performance criteria.

Designed and generated data visualizations with Matplotlib to illustrate trends, distributions, comparisons, and performance metrics in a clear and intuitive format for stakeholders.

Utilized Python, Pandas, and NumPy to achieve efficient, accurate, and scalable data processing and transformation workflows.

**Outcome:**

The project delivered clean, integrated, and analysis-ready datasets, reducing preprocessing time by 60% and enhancing reporting accuracy to over 98%. The automated workflows and visualizations empowered stakeholders to identify trends, monitor KPIs, and make faster, more informed business decisions
